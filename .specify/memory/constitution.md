# dnsmasq-k8s-ui Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Professional Aesthetics
The user interface and all user-facing materials must be polished, modern, and visually appealing. All design elements should be cohesive and contribute to a professional look and feel.

### II. High-Quality Standards
The project must adhere to high standards of quality. This includes writing clean, maintainable, and well-documented code. All contributions will be reviewed to ensure they meet these standards.

### III. Consistent User Experience
The user experience must be consistent and intuitive across the entire application. Common UI patterns and workflows should be used to ensure that users can easily navigate and interact with the application.

### IV. Test-Driven Development
All new functionality must be accompanied by tests. TDD is mandatory: Tests are written first, they must fail, and then the implementation should be written to make them pass. The Red-Green-Refactor cycle is strictly enforced.

### V. Clear and Concise Code
Code should be easy to read, understand, and maintain. Avoid unnecessary complexity and verbosity. Follow the YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It) principle.

## Development Standards

All code must be formatted according to the project's established style guide. All dependencies must be approved before being added to the project.

## Quality Assurance

All code must be reviewed and approved by at least one other contributor before being merged. All new functionality must be tested on all supported platforms.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments to this constitution require documentation, approval, and a migration plan. All pull requests and reviews must verify compliance with this constitution.
