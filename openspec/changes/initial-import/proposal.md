# Change: Initial Codebase Import

## Why
To establish a baseline for OpenSpec-driven development by importing the existing functionality of the `dnsmasq-k8s-ui` project into specifications. This allows future changes to be tracked against a known state.

## What Changes
- Creates initial specifications for:
    - DNS Management (A, CNAME, TXT records)
    - DHCP Management (Leases, Reservations)
    - Configuration Management (View, Edit, Validate)
    - Service Control (Supervisor integration)

## Impact
- **Affected specs**: None (New specs)
- **Affected code**: None (Documentation only)
